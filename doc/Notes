0003.0  20 Nov 2011 - Sunday

0003.1  Finished all unit tests for Railroad, Branch, Section and Track
        EXCEPT delete.  This probably could be done from the railroad test
        file but I'm not sure whether the fixtures for the children will be loaded.
        
        Giving it a try.
        
        Didn't need the fixture.  I added the railroad, added branches to railroad
        added section to one of the branches, added a track to the section.
        Then I tested to ensure that all of the objects were in the db.
        
        Next railroad.destroy and ensure that all of the objects are GONE!
        
        They are.
        
0003.2  Need to elaborate on tracks and their connections.

0002.0  19 Nov 2011 - Saturday

0002.1  Much progress on Friday and today. 

        Put a header just below the navigation tabs.  It shows the last 
        Railroad, Branch and Section selected by the user and responds appropriately
        to changes in the parent (e.g., if Railroad changes, Branch and Section are
        deselected).
        
        Updated the <nav-item> override to allow programatic control of tab
        visibility.  For backwards compatibility, it allows me to HIDE one
        or more tabs by setting a global variable $hide_tabs to string,
        symbol or array of strings (value corresponds to the model name of
        the tab - e.g., 'Branch')
        
        Diddled with the css to free up some vertical space.
        
0002.2  Implementing unit tests for Railroad, Branch, Section and Track.

        Noticed in log that the program is looking for magic_dispatcher.js
        on the path corresponding to the selected page!  NEED TO CHECK THIS OUT

0001.0  17 Nov 2011 - Thursday

0001.1  Trying to design the UI for the Tycoon which occupies the
        front page and looks something like this: (may be totally wrong)
        
        Railroad    <Dropdown>    <New button>  <Delete button>
        
        Branch      <Dropdown>    <New button>  <Delete button>
        
        Section     <Dropdown>    <New-button>  <Delete button>
        
        Track       <Dropdown>    <New-button>  <Delete button>
        
        ==================== Track Data ==========================
        
        <Track Type Dropdown> // e.g., Thru, Left Entry RH Turnout
        
        <East/North Left checkbox> // Default is East/North on right.
        
        <Track Class Dropdown> // e.g. Main, Passing, Siding/Industrial/Yard
        
        ----------- Connections -----------
        
        <UL Dropdown>               <UR Dropdown>
        <CL Dropdown>   Track Name  <CR Dropdown>
        <LL Dropdown>               <LR Dropdown>
        
        This looks cool, but the controller will be totally complicated.
        
        What I want is some way to select the Railroad which will be used
        to restrict the Branches on the Branch Index page, select the Branch 
        which will be used to restrict the Sections on the Section Index page
        and select the Section which will be used to restrict the Tracks on 
        the Track Index Page.
        
0001.2  A second idea which follows the Hobo theme a little more closely.

        Front page shows the last Railroad selected (or created) using
        the Railroad Tab (if railroad deleted, defaults to none as when
        there are no railroads initially)
        
        It also shows the last Branch selected (or created) using the
        Branch Tab - reset if Railroad changed or deleted.
        
        Similarly for the last Section selected....
